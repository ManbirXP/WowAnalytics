WoW! Analytics (WOW-A) is a trading platform to be used by World of Warcraft players. The website is intrinsically linked to the game's in-game economy, and also provides players with the ability to 

Motivation:
Over 100 million people play World of Warcraft. While there are many ways to play the game, a
common goal for all players is to grow more powerful. By defeating monsters and completing quests,
players grow in level and become eligible to don more and more powerful equipment. If a player fails
to keep their equipment up-to-date, then it becomes increasingly difficult overcome the challenges they
face. While adventuring, players may find equipment. While some of it may be useful to them, most of
the time it is better for other players who have chosen to specialize their character in a different way.
Therefore there is a huge motivation buy, sell, and trade equipment with other players.
Blizzard has a built-in system for trading equipment (and other goods) called the Auction
House. While it is widely used, the system is notoriously frustrating and wasteful for a few compelling
reasons:

#1 – Fees and Deposits:
Whenever a player posts an auction to the Auction House, they must pay a large deposit,
sometimes up to 50% of what the item is worth on the market. If the item does not sell, then the deposit
is lost. Even if the item sells, about 10% of the amount paid disappears, “taken” by the non-player
characters who “run the Auction House”.

#2 – Short Auctions:
A player's auctions can only be hosted by a maximum of 48 hours. If no one buys it in
that time, then the player most take the time and effort to revisit the Auction House with the item, and
set their asking price yet again. If a player has many items for sale, then it becomes prohibitively time-
consuming to keep them on the market.

#3 – Irrelevant Results:
When looking for new equipment, players have the option to order the search results
based on several criteria, but even after maximizing the effectiveness of the sorting options, the results are
littered with irrelevant equipment a player will never benefit from using. 

#4 – No Data
The Auction House provides no data about the historical asking price of goods for sale. This makes it difficult to appraise items a player wishes to sell, and makes it hard to know if they're getting a good deal, or if they should wait for a better deal. 

About the Product:
WoW Auction Intelligence seeks to improve the buying and selling experience for World
of Warcraft players by addressing the issues mentioned above. A website has been created which
integrates several important datasets made available through Blizzard APIs, including:

#1 – Approximately once an hour, Blizzard updates their APIs with all of the auctions currently
available in the game's Auction House. Each auction has a unique Item ID#, minimum bid and buyout
price.

#2 – A second dataset relates the Item ID#s to the information about that item. Merging the two
datasets provides a clear picture of what is available in the Auction House.

#3 – Blizzard provides a plug-in for third-party websites that allows players to log into their
accounts. In doing so, information about their characters, including what equipment they have, what
items they possess, and how much money they have, are made available to the WoW Analytics
database.
These datasets allow for the construction of a more sophisticated user interface, one which right
away can find the most cost-effective upgrades, or, if money is not a concern, can simply display the
best equipment for their character.
WoW Auction Intelligence can also be used to facilitate no-cost trade. Using the website,
players may select items which they want to sell and set their asking price. These items are merged
with those which are in the Auction House, ensuring that the website provides the most complete
picture of what items are available.
